### Preparation Instructions:

**1. Prepare the Eggplants:**  
- Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F).  
- Salt the eggplant slices on both sides and let them sit for 20 minutes to remove bitterness. Rinse and pat dry.  
- Heat olive oil in a large skillet and fry the eggplant slices until golden on both sides. Drain on paper towels. Alternatively, brush with olive oil and roast in oven for 20 minutes flipping halfway.

**2. Make the Meat Sauce:**  
- In a large pan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Sauté onions and garlic until translucent.  
- Add ground meat and cook until browned.  
- Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine (if using), oregano, cinnamon, salt, and pepper.  
- Simmer uncovered for 20-30 minutes until thickened. Adjust seasoning.

**3. Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:**  
- Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.  
- Whisk in flour and cook for 1-2 minutes until it forms a roux but does not brown.  
- Gradually whisk in warm milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.  
- Cook until sauce thickens to a creamy consistency.  
- Remove from heat, add nutmeg, salt, and pepper.  
- Temper eggs by adding a small amount of the hot sauce to the beaten eggs, then stir eggs into the sauce.  
- Stir in half the grated cheese.

**4. Assemble the Moussaka:**  
- In a baking dish, layer half the eggplants at the bottom.  
- Spread all the meat sauce evenly over the eggplants.  
- Layer the remaining eggplants on top.  
- Pour the béchamel sauce evenly over the top.  
- Sprinkle remaining cheese on the béchamel.  
- Bake in preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for 45-50 minutes until golden and bubbling. Let rest 15 minutes before serving.

**5. Prepare the Greek Salad:**  
- In a large bowl, combine tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, green pepper, and olives.  
- Drizzle with olive oil and vinegar/lemon juice.  
- Season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Toss gently.  
- Top with feta cheese cubes or crumbles.

**6. Make the Tzatziki:**  
- In a bowl, combine Greek yogurt, grated cucumber, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, dill, and salt.  
- Mix well and refrigerate until serving.
