### Preparation Instructions:

**1. Prepare the Eggplants:**  
- Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F).  
- Salt the eggplant slices on both sides and let them sit for 20 minutes to remove bitterness. Rinse and pat dry.  
- Heat olive oil in a large skillet and fry the eggplant slices until golden on both sides. Drain on paper towels. Alternatively, brush with olive oil and roast in oven for 20 minutes flipping halfway.

**2. Make the Vegetarian "Meat" Sauce:**  
- In a large pan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Sauté onions and garlic until translucent.  
- Add chopped mushrooms and cook until softened and browned, about 5-7 minutes.  
- Stir in cooked lentils, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine (if using), oregano, cinnamon, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.  
- Simmer uncovered for 20-30 minutes until thickened and flavors meld. Adjust seasoning as needed.

**3. Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:**  
- Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.  
- Whisk in flour and cook for 1-2 minutes until it forms a roux but does not brown.  
- Gradually whisk in warm milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.  
- Cook until sauce thickens to a creamy consistency.  
- Remove from heat, add nutmeg, salt, and pepper.  
- Temper eggs by adding a small amount of the hot sauce to the beaten eggs, then stir eggs into the sauce. (For vegan alternative, whisk chickpea flour mixture directly into sauce.)  
- Stir in half the grated cheese or nutritional yeast.

**4. Assemble the Moussaka:**  
- In a baking dish, layer half the eggplants at the bottom.  
- Spread all the vegetarian "meat" sauce evenly over the eggplants.  
- Layer the remaining eggplants on top.  
- Pour the béchamel sauce evenly over the top.  
- Sprinkle remaining cheese on the béchamel.  
- Bake in preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for 45-50 minutes until golden and bubbling. Let rest 15 minutes before serving.

**5. Prepare the Greek Salad:**  
- In a large bowl, combine tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, green pepper, and olives.  
- Drizzle with olive oil and vinegar/lemon juice.  
- Season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Toss gently.  
- Top with feta cheese cubes or crumbles.

**6. Make the Tzatziki:**  
- In a bowl, combine Greek yogurt, grated cucumber, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, dill, and salt.  
- Mix well and refrigerate until serving.

### Serving Suggestions:

- Serve a generous slice of warm vegetarian moussaka accompanied by a fresh Greek salad on the side.  
- Add a dollop of tzatziki on the plate or in a small bowl for dipping.  
- Warm the crusty bread or pita bread and serve alongside to scoop up sauce and salad.  
- Pair with a chilled glass of dry white wine such as Assyrtiko or a light red like Agiorgitiko for an authentic Greek experience.  
- For dessert, consider serving Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts or fresh figs.

### Explanation of Replaced Ingredients:

- **Ground lamb/beef replaced with a mixture of cooked lentils and finely chopped mushrooms:** Lentils provide a hearty, protein-rich base that mimics the texture and nutritional profile of ground meat, while mushrooms add umami depth and a meaty texture that keeps the sauce rich and satisfying without losing the essence of traditional moussaka. The combination ensures the sauce is flavorful and filling.  
- **Added smoked paprika:** To enhance the depth and smoky notes often found in meat sauces, complementing the cinnamon and oregano.  
- **For béchamel, eggs retained for classic texture, with a vegan alternative using chickpea flour:** This keeps the sauce creamy and rich. Cheese can be substituted with vegetarian hard cheese or nutritional yeast for those avoiding animal rennet or dairy.  
- **Greek salad and tzatziki remain unchanged:** They are already vegetarian and perfectly complement the moussaka.  
- **Olive oil remains the primary fat source:** Healthy, traditional, and flavorful.

This adaptation keeps the traditional flavors, textures, and heartiness of the Greek dinner intact while making it entirely vegetarian, nutritious, and accessible with common home ingredients.
