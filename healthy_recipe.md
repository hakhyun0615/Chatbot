**2. Vegetarian Moussaka**

**Ingredients:**
- 2 large eggplants, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
- Salt, for sprinkling
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 400g canned tomatoes, diced
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 zucchini, diced
- 1 cup cooked lentils
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 500ml milk or plant-based milk
- 100g grated Parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast
- 2 egg yolks or 2 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with water for a vegan option

**Preparation Instructions:**
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Sprinkle the eggplant slices with salt and let them sit for 20 minutes. Rinse and pat dry.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Fry the eggplant slices in batches until golden brown. Set aside.
4. In the same pan, add the remaining olive oil and sauté the onion and garlic until soft. Add the zucchini and continue to sauté for a few minutes.
5. Stir in the canned tomatoes, tomato paste, cinnamon, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 10 minutes until thickened. Add the cooked lentils and mix well.
6. In a saucepan, melt the butter and stir in the flour to form a paste. Gradually whisk in the milk, cooking until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat and stir in half the Parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast and the egg yolks or cornstarch mixture.
7. In a baking dish, layer half of the eggplant slices, then half of the lentil mixture. Repeat with remaining eggplant and sauce. Pour the white sauce over the top and sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast.
8. Bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes until golden and bubbling.

**Serving Suggestions:**
- Allow the moussaka to cool slightly before slicing. Serve with a side of Greek salad.

**Explanation of the Replaced Ingredients:**
- Ground lamb or beef has been replaced with a combination of zucchini and lentils to provide the texture and protein content without compromising on flavor. Nutritional yeast is used as an alternative to Parmesan cheese for a vegan option, and cornstarch mixed with water can replace egg yolks for binding.

4. Cut the baklava into diamond shapes with a sharp knife.
5. Bake for 45 minutes or until golden brown.

**Serving Suggestions:**

**Explanation of the Replaced Ingredients:**
